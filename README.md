# Enredada
This is the repository of the Unity Project of Enredada. A short interactive experience where music and story unfold as you play, developed in a 2-day period on Global Game Jam 2023, on Image Campus Jam Site.

There was very little time, I was solo developing, and the focus was on reaching the deadline with the best user experience possible for the game, so the scripts are very unclean.

The game can be played on Itch.io: https://ignaciollacay.itch.io/enredada
